## How to Solve Algorithm Problems: Make Coding Interview Preparation Less Painful

Preparing for coding interviews can often be a daunting task, causing stress and anxiety for many individuals. Several factors contribute to this feeling:



- **Scattered and overwhelming information:** The abundance of resources available, including online tutorials, blog posts, and coding platforms, can make it difficult to know where to start or which materials to focus on. The sheer volume of information can be overwhelming and make the preparation process feel disorganized.
- **Lack of clarity in the coding interview process:** The interview process itself may lack clear guidelines or a standardized structure. Each company or organization may have its own unique approach, making it challenging to know what specific topics or coding problems to prioritize during preparation. This lack of clarity can add to the uncertainty and stress of the interview preparation phase.
- **External biases, such as company and team culture:** The culture and values of the company conducting the coding interview, as well as the team you may potentially join, can introduce additional pressure.
As a result, many candidates find themselves on a bumpy road, investing excessive time in solving numerous leetcode problems. This approach often leads to confusion, frustration, wasted time, and missed opportunities to demonstrate their coding skills during interviews.


It's crucial to move beyond solely solving leetcode problems and adopt a new approach to your preparation that emphasizes studying algorithms and data structures effectively.
